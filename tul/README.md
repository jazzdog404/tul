Exersize Time Under Load timer

This is a web app designed for mobile that allows you to track exersize 'time under load'

I created it for use with the exersize program described in the book Body by Science: A Research Based Program to Get the Results You Want in 12 Minutes a Week, by John R. Little and Doug McGuff.

The essence of the program: 5 weight lifting exersizes, performed with a weight that causes your muscles to fail within a couple minutes, and that workout being done once every week or two.

This app helps you track weight and time under load per exersize/workout.

Something similar is apparently called HIT Workouts. Perhaps this app would be useful for that too.

Issues: 

1) The view is styled for an iPhone 5/SE, because that's what I have. Might need other styling for other viewports.
2) The program calls for tracking time between exersizes. This app does not support that. I find that I don't have much control of that; if somebody is using a machine, I wait.
